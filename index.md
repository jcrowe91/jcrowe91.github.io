Hello there, my name is Jake. After a rewarding decade-long career in manufacturing, I've decided to learn to code.<br>
I've always enjoyed technology, as well as working with my hands, so CNC programming led me to C# programming.

## Education:
[TrueCoders](https://truecoders.io/) — Advanced Technical Training <br>
Aug 2021 - Feb 2022

TrueCoders is a project and lecture-based training program that aims to fill the growing need for data science and software development jobs in Alabama. Projects include multiple personal and group-oriented tasks that involve multiple programming languages throughout the program.
Over 500 hours of intensive, project-based training in programming languages and other technical skills, such as C#, .NET Core, SQL, Git, ASP.NET MVC, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
These skills were developed by building multiple C# and SQL projects.<br>
C# and SQL Projects were tracked using Git and GitHub for source control.

## Project Portfolio:

My personal Github repository is linked at the top of this page, as well as below in Contact Information.
Here I'll showcase a few projects I've built, as well as give some insights to how the code works
and I'll link directly to the repo:

[Phonebook Application](https://github.com/jcrowe91/PhoneBookApplication/tree/main/PhoneBookApplication)
-A fully functional application that will take in user contact information, allow for CRUD operations, and save to/read from a .csv file. Also includes an API.

[ASP.NET MVC Project](https://github.com/jcrowe91/ASPNET)
-ASP.NET MVC Framework used to create a project that allows for CRUD operations to be used with a MySQL Database. 

[KanyeREST API Application](https://github.com/jcrowe91/APIExercise)
-C# .Net Core Application where I use two different APIs to obtain quotes from Kanye West as JSON Objects, and quotes from Ron Swanson as JSON Arrays. The quotes are then used to simulate a conversation between the two.

[Taco Parser](https://github.com/jcrowe91/TacoParser)
-C# .NET Core Application where I parse data from a csv file to reference Taco Bell Locations. That data is then used to calculate the distance between the two locations that are farthest apart. 


## Work Experience:
-[A & W Machine Shop](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/0432836D:US), Birmingham Alabama— Lead Machinist <br>
July 2010 - PRESENT

  I've spent ten years working in machine shops. For the most part, I've
worked as a lead machinist at A & W Machine, learning to operate every machine and
piece of equipment available to me. This includes lathes (including Verticle Turret Lathes), milling
machines, boring mills, threading machines, overhead cranes, etc. I am a certified forklift operator.

-[Zorn Molds](http://www.zornmolds.com/), Trafford Alabama — CNC Machinist <br>
Septemeber 2020 - March 2021

  I left there for a while while I was working on my degree to go learn about Computer Numeric
Controlled machining. This is a high end, fast-paced process to make extremely precise parts using
CAD/CAM and GCode, a programming language using numbers. I started to work at Zorn Molds, which
I had worked part-time in the afternoon until they offered me a full-time position. I learned a lot
at Zorn about making high-quality parts for molding machines. I also learned KANBAN systems, as
well as some experience in woodworking and 3D printing.

-[MetSouth](https://met-south.com/), Hanceville Alabama — CNC Machinist <br>
March 2021 - September 2021

  From there I was offered an apprenticeship
at MetrologySouth, a company that works in the automotive and aerospace industry. I got to learn about
Computer-Aided Design and programming on multi-axis machines. I also got experience in
welding and fabricating while I was there.

I was eventually offered a job back at A & W to learn under
the shop supervisor, so I went back. All in all, it's been a very rewarding career.
