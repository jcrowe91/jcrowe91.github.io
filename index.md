Software Developer and Machinist.

Hello there, my name is Jake. After a rewarding decade-long career in manufacturing, I've decided to learn to code.<br>
I've always enjoyed technology, as well as working with my hands, so CNC programming led me to C# programming.

## Education:
-True Coders — Advanced Technical Training — Aug 2021 - Feb 2022

The TrueCoders training program is a project and lecture-based training program that aims to fill the growing need for data science and software development jobs in Alabama. Projects include multiple personal and group-oriented tasks that involve multiple programming languages throughout the program.
Over 500 hours of intensive, project-based training in programming languages and other technical skills, such as C#, .NET Core, SQL, Git, ASP.NET MVC, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
These skills were developed by building multiple C# and SQL projects.
C# and SQL Projects were tracked using Git and GitHub for source control.

## Work Experience:
-A & W Machine Shop, Birmingham Alabama— Lead Machinist
July 2010 - PRESENT

  I've spent ten years working in machine shops. For the most part, I've
worked as a lead machinist at A & W Machine, learning to operate every machine and
piece of equipment available to me. This includes lathes (including Verticle Turret Lathes), milling
machines, boring mills, threading machines, overhead cranes, etc. I am a certified forklift operator.

-Zorn Molds, Trafford Alabama — CNC Machinist
Septemeber 2020 - March 2021

  I left there for a while while I was working on my degree to go learn about Computer Numeric
Controlled machining. This is a high end, fast-paced process to make extremely precise parts using
CAD/CAM and GCode, a programming language using numbers. I started to work at Zorn Molds, which
I had worked part-time in the afternoon until they offered me a full-time position. I learned a lot
at Zorn about making high-quality parts for molding machines. I also learned KANBAN systems, as
well as some experience in woodworking and 3D printing.

-MetSouth, Hanceville Alabama — CNC Machinist
March 2021 - September 2021

  From there I was offered an apprenticeship
at MetrologySouth, a company that works in the automotive and aerospace industry. I got to learn about
Computer-Aided Design and programming on multi-axis machines. I also got experience in
welding and fabricating while I was there.

I was eventually offered a job back at A & W to learn under
the shop supervisor, so I went back. All in all, it's been a very rewarding career.

My personal Github repository is linked at the top of this page, as well as below in Contact Information.
Here I'll showcase a few projects I've built, as well as give some insights to how the code works
and I'll link directly to the repo:
